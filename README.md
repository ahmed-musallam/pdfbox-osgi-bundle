# Pdfbox OSGI Bundle

A simple project to bundle pdfbox and ALL its dependencies into one bundle.

## Usage
This is just a sample that shows you the `maven-bundle-plugins` directives to use as well as what maven dependencies to include.
n your project, use the same directives I am using in the `maven-bundle-plugin` and also include the same dependencies. This should make pdfbox available to you in your OSGI container (AEM in my case).
